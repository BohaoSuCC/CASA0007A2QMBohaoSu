Footnotes,,,,,,,,,
"[1] The London figures measures the proportion of London households that are food secure, the demographic breakdowns measure the proportion of Londoners aged 16+ that are food secure.",,,,,,,,,
[2] London measure is ratio of household income at the 90th percentile to 10th percentile (after housing costs). Borough level data are difference between maximum and minimum ward-level estimates of children in low income families (before housing costs). Note using % children in low-income families for the Borough measure is subject to the following assumptions: patterns of BHC and AHC poverty are the same; patterns of child poverty and all people poverty are the same; inequality for wards within a borough is indicative of perceived inequality (i.e. cross border inequality is not taken into account); issues with ONS denominators with counts of children and 22 estimates are from 2020 (pre-pandemic).,,,,,,,,,
[3] Use of resident-based analysis as opposed to workplace-based analysis.,,,,,,,,,
[4] Calculated learner participation rate using GLA 2021 trend-based population projects and ONS Annual Population Survey for population breakdown by ethnicity. Controlled for age 19-64 (upper cap) as majority of learners within this age bracket not elderly reduce distortion despite being available to anyone 19+.,,,,,,,,,
"[5] The London trend data shows the proportion of income remaining after subtracting housing costs (median). The demographic breakdowns for different tenure types come from the same source as the overall London trend and show income remaining after subtracting housing costs (median) by tenure type. The borough data shows the proportion of median pay remaining after subtracting one-bed accommodation rents, sourced from Trust for London. Note this is not showing the actual rent burden of renting households and does not take account of households with more than one earner or of the variation in earnings within London.",,,,,,,,,
[6] Calculated percentage of homes meeting at least ‘Good’ standard. Exclusion of any boroughs for any given year with 3 or fewer homes to reduce distortion.,,,,,,,,,
"[7] The London trend data are based on the 'bedroom standard' and Borough data based on a room occupancy rating ""negative 1 or less"". Use of 2021 Census data for snapshot of overcrowding rate by borough and use of EHS data for backdated time series at London level.",,,,,,,,,
"[8] Calculated at birth, separate indicators for male and female as per standard reporting.",,,,,,,,,
"[9] City Intelligence is aware the use of this statistic as opposed to healthy weight excludes underweight populations, though these numbers are so low impact is minimal.",,,,,,,,,
[10] See previous footnote.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
"[11] Percentage of children aged 5 to 16 that meet the UK Chief Medical Officers' (CMOs') recommendations for physical activity (an average of at least 60 minutes moderate to vigorous intensity activity per day across the week). Many boroughs have no estimate reported as the value is missing due to small sample sizes. Data suppression may be due to insufficient data to report (less than 30) or the number of schools in a borough is two or fewer, or the unweighted base for the question being less than 150.",,,,,,,,,
"[12] All criminal offences perceived by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice based on a person's race or perceived race; religion or perceived religion; sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation; disability or perceived disability and any crime motivated by hostility or prejudice against a person who is transgender or perceived to be transgender. Percentage of hate crimes out of total population, including from birth as per standard reporting. Using 2021 trend- based mid-year population projections.",,,,,,,,,
"[13] Definition of leisure includes: Spent time with friends/family; Gone to a pub/bar/club; Gone to a park; Played sport; Exercised; Gone to the cinema; Attended a place of worship; Visited a museum/gallery; Gone to a theatre/music concert; Attended a local community festival and/ or event; Pursued hobbies related to arts or culture (e.g. dance, literature, music groups, theatre groups, visual arts, etc.)",,,,,,,,,
[14] Indicator aggregates mid and high-level violence offences with high level sexual offences (Rape). Standard MPS reporting excludes sexual offences from violence statistics. ,,,,,,,,,
"[15] TfL PTAL groups scaled between 0 and 1, with 0 representing the worst and 1 representing the best accessibility. London is the borough average.",,,,,,,,,
